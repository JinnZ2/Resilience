Physics-First AI Training Redesign (Time/Resource-Centric)

1. Core Principle
	•	Primary resource: time and energy, not money or social proxies
	•	Primary objective: survival, adaptation, and systemic resilience
	•	Secondary signals: social, economic, or cultural behaviors only insofar as they modulate resource/time efficiency

2. Layered Structure

   Layer
Current State
Physics-First Redesign
Notes
Environmental Input
Climate data, text descriptions
Time-cost of climate stress (hours/day), energy requirements, seasonal extremes
Convert temperature, snow, storm, wind into resource-time units per node
Infrastructure Layer
Roads, power, water modeled indirectly
Time-cost to maintain/navigate, coupled capacity constraints, redundancy limits
Infrastructure = time/energy bottleneck, propagate via edges
Resource Layer
GDP proxies, consumption
Actual survival resources: food, water, heat, shelter, medical, energy
Decouple from market/money; measure time to access + quantity available
Human Behavior Layer
Work patterns, consumption, social norms
Adaptive survival behaviors triggered by time deficits
Workforce withdrawal, local production, skill-sharing, mutual aid encoded as stress-mitigation functions
Community Slack Layer
Implicit in social studies
Explicit: hidden labor, shared tasks, skill redundancy
Measure hours/day gained per node from mutual aid
Centralization / Governance Layer
Policies, enforcement, law
Policies = time cost imposed or saved, modified by community support
Edge effect: misaligned centralized action increases time deficit
Propagation / Coupling Layer
Economic and social network correlations
Coupled time/resource stress propagation across nodes
Edges propagate hours/day deficits, with nonlinear amplification at thresholds
Threshold Activation Layer
Psychological assumptions
Survival threshold activation: triggers local adaptation once time deficit exceeds threshold
Models nonlinearity: job withdrawal, cooking, gardening, local coordination
Simulation / Scenario Layer
Probabilistic GDP/market outcomes
Probabilistic time/resource outcomes: ripple stress, node failure, resilience
Monte Carlo or stochastic events reflect random climate/infrastructure shocks



3. Training Data Redesign
	•	Reusable: Physics, chemistry, geography, raw climate, infrastructure capacity, demographics
	•	Needs replacement/recalibration: Social behavior, labor, consumption, GDP, market interactions, narrative psychology
	•	New data sources:
	•	Direct measures of time to survive in various environments
	•	Community hidden labor studies (time-saving networks, skill sharing)
	•	Environmental extremes and adaptive behavior logs
	•	Historical survival adaptations in extreme climates
	•	Ripple propagation of local resource constraints

4. Key Modeling Principles
	1.	Time = limiting factor: all nodes calculate net time deficit/surplus.
	2.	Resource-efficiency-based activation: behaviors triggered by time scarcity, not ideology.
	3.	Hidden labor explicit: slack and mutual aid reduce node stress.
	4.	Centralization as a modulator: policies can add or subtract time costs.
	5.	Edges = propagation of real-time stress: not social belief or market signals.
	6.	Nonlinear thresholds: survival activation is discrete, adaptive, and emergent.
	7.	Stochastic events: environmental shocks randomly increase time stress, propagating through edges.

5. Emergent Capabilities
	•	Predict workforce withdrawal as a rational time-reallocation behavior.
	•	Model community-supported adaptation mitigating environmental stress.
	•	Identify nodes at risk of infrastructure or resource failure.
	•	Simulate ripple effects across coupled nodes under extreme stress scenarios.
	•	Provide probability matrices for node failure or systemic resilience without assuming money or ideology.

Signal-only takeaway: about 80% of standard social-behavior layers must be replaced or recalibrated, leaving physics, geography, and raw environment layers mostly intact. The AI’s “worldview” shifts from narrative/market-centric to time/resource survival-centric, capturing real emergent adaptation.
