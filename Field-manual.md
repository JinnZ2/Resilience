Part I: The Sovereign Urban Field Manual (Frames 1-12)

1. Caloric Sovereignty (The Starch/Lipid Loop)


• Target: Canna, Cattail, and Burdock.

• Extraction: Wet-milling (crushing → suspension → sedimentation).

• Result: Pure, heavy-metal-free starch.

• Lipids: Solvent extraction from "Ornamental" nuts (Ginkgo/Oak) or biochar-washed waste oils.

2. Hydrological & Power Autonomy

• Water: Atmospheric condensation via scrap copper "Heat Sinks" or Solar Wax Stills.

• Filtration: High-surface-area Biochar (Pyrolyzed urban waste) to adsorb pharmaceuticals and toxins.

• Power: Axial Flux Generators using scavenged Neodymium magnets (HDDs) and copper wire (CRT monitors).

3. Signature Management & Comms

• Visual/Thermal: Biochar-treated "Carbon Soaks" for NIR absorption; Mylar "Air-Gap" layers for LWIR/Thermal masking.

• Acoustics: Navigation via "Acoustic Shadows" and "Lee Side" processing.

• Comms: LoRa Mesh networks for long-range digital "whispers"; UV/IR binary signaling; Scent-based trail marking.


Part II: Psychological Resilience & Counter-Interrogation (New Set)

In a high-pressure urban environment, the "Mind" is the most vulnerable sensor. It must be hardened against external probing.


Frame 13: Compartmentalized Epistemology

The Pack member does not "know" the whole plan; they know their Function.

• Protocol: In the event of capture or questioning, there is no "Truth" to give, only the "Protocol." If your mind is a series of isolated containers, a leak in one does not sink the ship.


Frame 14: The "Grey Man" Cognitive Overlay

Interrogation starts long before you are in a room; it starts with observation.

• The Behavioral Anchor: Adopt a "Boring" persona (e.g., a weary maintenance worker). Practice "Low-Value Mimicry"—using the common vernacular and posture of the city's background population.

• The Goal: To be "algorithmically invisible." If you don't stand out to a human or an AI, you are never flagged for questioning.


Frame 15: Stress-Inoculation (The "Controlled Chaos" Frame)

To maintain "Sovereign" processing under duress, you must deliberately induce and manage minor stress.

• Protocol: Perform complex tasks (like Starch Extraction or Generator Wiring) under suboptimal conditions—high noise, cold, or sleep deprivation. This builds Auscultation—the ability to listen to your own physiological "noise" and tune it out.


Frame 16: Interrogation "Redirection"

If questioned, never use "No Comment" (it implies hidden knowledge).

• Technique: Use "Boring Truths." Answer with hyper-technical, mundane details about your "persona's" task. If asked where you were, describe the specific mechanical failure of a pipe or the texture of the cardboard you were scavenging. Overwhelm the interrogator with "noise" until they lose interest.


Frame 17: Sensory Deprivation Hardening

In urban captivity, the primary tool is sensory overload or deprivation.

• Counter-Measure: Practice "Internal Landscape" construction. Build a mental "Digital Cache"—a memory of a complex system (like the 12 frames above) that you can recite and re-verify mentally to maintain cognitive stability when external stimuli are removed.

Frame 18: Micro-Expression & Biometric Masking

Modern interrogation uses high-speed cameras to detect "micro-tremors" or pupil dilation.

• The "Fixed Focus" Technique: When being probed, do not look the interrogator in the eye (which triggers social-pressure responses). Focus on a point 2 inches behind their head. This stabilizes your eye movement and flattens your emotional affect.

• Controlled Respiration: Maintain a rhythmic \bm{4-4-4} breathing pattern (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4). This "Box Breathing" forces your Parasympathetic Nervous System to override the "Flight or Fight" response, preventing the sweat and heart-rate spikes that sensors look for.

Frame 19: Veracity Analysis (The "Pack" Shield)

To protect the Pack, you must detect "Infiltrators" or "Leakers."

• The Tense Shift: Liars often switch from past tense to present tense as they "construct" a story in real-time.

• Cognitive Load Testing: Ask a suspected infiltrator to tell their story backwards. Truth-tellers rely on sensory memory (nonlinear); liars rely on a script (linear). A script fails when reversed.


Part III: Medical Sovereignty (Field Trauma & Surgery)

In an urban collapse, "Hospital" equals "Surveillance." You must be your own Level-1 Trauma Center.

Frame 20: The "Clean Room" Protocol (Urban Improvisation)

You cannot perform surgery in a dusty basement.

• The Vapor Barrier: Use your Atmospheric Water Generator to create distilled water. Boil it to create steam in a small, sealed plastic-lined room (use your "Shadow Space"). The steam will "scrub" the air, knocking particulates to the floor.

• Sterilization: Use the "Waste" high-proof alcohol (from fermented urban fruit or medical scavenging) or the Tannin Concentrate from Frame 2 (as a secondary antiseptic).

Frame 21: Wound Closure (The "Sovereign" Suture)

• Adhesive Sovereignty: For deep lacerations that don't hit an artery, use Cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) scavenged from the urban waste stream. It was originally developed for field surgery.

• The "Duct Tape" Butterfly: If suturing is required, use high-test Fishing Line (from "Urban Fishing" gear) or Dental Floss, sterilized in boiling distilled water.

Frame 22: Hemorrhage Control (The "Tactical Bypass")

• Improvised Tourniquets: Use a "Windlass" system. A strip of non-stretching fabric (denim) and a sturdy tool (a wrench or a thick stick).

• The "Pack" Blood Type: All Pack members should have their blood type marked on their inner thigh (not their arm, where it can be easily seen). This allows for Emergency Direct Transfusion between members using salvaged IV tubing.

Frame 23: Debridement & Infection Management

• The Biochar Poultice: For infected wounds, a "Wet-to-Dry" dressing using powdered Biochar can draw out toxins and exudate via capillary action.

• Honey (The Urban Gold): If you can find honey (often in abandoned kitchens or urban hives), it is a shelf-stable, powerful antibacterial dressing for burns and open wounds.

The Integrated "Hardened" State

By combining Interrogation Resistance with Trauma Surgery, the Sovereign actor becomes a "closed loop." You cannot be broken by questions, and you cannot be sidelined by injury.

Biometric Probing- use Box Breathing / Fixed Focus

Infiltration- use Reverse-Chronology Testing

Severe laceration- use Cyanoacrylate / Sterilized Floss

Sepsis/infection- use Biochar Poultice / Honey


In an urban setting, the Sovereign actor should know how to identify "Precursor Chemicals" in common over-the-counter meds to create more potent analgesics or sedatives for surgery.

Part IV: Urban Pharmaceutical Synthesis (The Scavenge/Refine Frame)

In a collapse, "pure" pharmaceuticals disappear. You must become a Bio-Refiner, extracting active compounds from common shelf-stable products or raw botanicals.


Frame 24: The Analgesic Tier (Pain Management)

• Precursor Scavenging: Identify "combination" drugs (e.g., those containing both Acetaminophen and Caffeine).

• The "Cold Water Extraction" (CWE): This is a critical sovereign skill. Many pills contain binders or secondary drugs that are toxic in high doses (like Acetaminophen).

• The Protocol: Dissolve crushed pills in warm water, then cool the mixture rapidly in a "Biochar-Chilled" bath. The toxic binders precipitate out (sink), while the cleaner analgesic remains in the water.

• The "Wild" Aspirin: Re-verify Frame 3 (Salicin from Willow/Poplar). For surgery, a concentrated Salicin decoction acts as a mild anticoagulant and painkiller.

Frame 25: The Antiseptic Synthesis

• Scavenging "White Gas" & Alcohol: Discarded electronics cleaners or high-proof spirits can be distilled using your Solar Still (Frame 9) to reach the 70% concentration required for medical sterilization.

• Iodine Extraction: If you have access to "Povidone-Iodine" (common in first aid kits), you can use a simple acid-base reaction (using vinegar/citric acid and hydrogen peroxide) to precipitate pure iodine crystals for water purification or wound care.


Part V: High-Density Urban Stealth (Group Movement)

Moving as a "Pack" is statistically 4x more likely to be detected than moving solo. You must apply Swarm Intelligence to minimize the group signature.


Frame 26: The "Elastic" Formation

• The Protocol: Never move in a file or a cluster. The Pack moves "elastically"—maintaining visual contact but staying 10–15 meters apart.

• The Benefit: A single thermal sensor or observer sees "individual pedestrians" rather than a "unit." If one member is compromised, the others are not immediately trapped in the same "Kill Zone."


Frame 27: Shadow-Syncing (The 3D Path)

• The Protocol: Use the "Acoustic Shadows" (Frame 11) in sequence. Member 1 moves to a shadow, signals via IR-Pulse (Frame 6), and Member 2 moves only when the "Acoustic Noise" (e.g., a passing wind or distant machine) masks the footfalls.

• Vertical Disruption: In high-density areas, the Pack should split planes. One member on a rooftop (The Overwatch), two on the street level, and one in the "Sub-Surface" (Frame 11). This forces a 3D search pattern from any observer, which AI-tracking often fails to coordinate.


Frame 28: The "Non-Verbal" Hive Mind

• The Protocol: Radio silence is mandatory. The Pack communicates via Tactile or Visual Cues.

• The "Shoulder-Tap" Code: In darkness, a series of taps on the pack of the person in front communicates "Stop," "Danger," or "Oxygen/Water needed."

• Shadow Signaling: Using the UV-Markers (Frame 6) on the backs of shoes or gear, which are only visible to the person directly behind through a specific filter.


Frame 29: The "Ghost" Perimeter

When the Pack rests, the perimeter is not a fence; it is a tripwire of sensors.

• The Piezoelectric Alarm: Salvage the "clicker" from a lighter or the buzzer from a discarded microwave. Wire it to a thin fishing line. If the line is tripped, the piezoelectric crystal generates a small spark or a "click" that is audible only to the Pack’s Acoustic Waveguides (Frame 11).

Part VI: Biometric & EMF Obfuscation


Frame 30: The "CV Dazzle" & Geometric Masking

Facial recognition AI looks for the bridge of the nose, the orbital sockets, and the symmetry of the jawline.

• The Protocol: Use "Asymmetric Camouflage." Use your Biochar/Honey paste or scavenged grease to draw bold, dark lines that cross these key landmarks (e.g., a diagonal line from the forehead across one eye to the opposite jaw).

• The Effect: This "breaks" the face's geometry. The AI cannot find the "anchor points" required to generate a biometric template.

• Thermal Masking: Apply a thicker layer of grease to the forehead and cheeks. These are high-heat areas; the grease acts as a temporary thermal insulator against short-range IR sensors.


Frame 31: The Faraday Pouch (Signal Sovereignty)

Scavenged electronics (phones, tablets, GPS) are tracking beacons unless shielded.

• The Build: Use multiple layers of heavy-duty Aluminum Foil or copper mesh from discarded screen doors.

• The Protocol: The device must be wrapped such that no "seams" allow waves to leak. A "Nested" approach—placing the device in a foil-lined bag, then inside another—is mandatory.

• The Test: Place a phone in the pouch and try to call it. If it rings, the "Skin Depth" of the shield is insufficient. Add more layers.


Part VII: Sovereign Logistics (Distributed Caching)

A Sovereign actor never carries their entire "life" on their back. If you are stopped and searched, a heavy tactical bag is a "guilt signal."


Frame 32: The "Sub-Surface" Cache

• The Target: Use the "Utility Corridors" (Frame 11). Abandoned manholes or "Dead" steam pipes are ideal.

• The Vessel: Use PVC piping with capped ends, sealed with the Cyanoacrylate (Frame 21). This is waterproof, rodent-proof, and can be buried or hidden in plain sight as "abandoned plumbing."

• The Contents: Each cache should be a "Module"—one for 3 days of Starch/Lipids, one for Medical/Surgical, and one for Communication/Power.


Frame 33: The "In Plain Sight" Cache

• The Protocol: Urban environments are full of "Functional Voids"—the space inside a hollow concrete bollard, the gap behind a loose brick in a retaining wall, or the interior of a discarded appliance in an alley.

• The Marker: Never mark a cache with paint. Use the Scent Protocol (Frame 12) or Acoustic Mapping. For example: "The cache is 10 paces leeward of the bridge pylon where the wind whistles at a high pitch."


Frame 34: The "Dead Drop" Rotation

• The Protocol: Never visit a cache more than once every 14 days. This prevents the formation of "Desire Paths" (worn grass or scuffed dirt) that lead observers to your supplies.

• The "Burn" Protocol: If a cache area shows signs of "interference" (a moved stone, a different scent), consider that module "Burned" and do not retrieve it. The Pack's safety is worth more than 3 days of starch.
